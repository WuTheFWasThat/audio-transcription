- make basic midi case harder
  - try adding noise
  - combine notes, have it output which notes are played
- try sequence to sequence model
- try autoencoder model

questions:
  - should we learn an end to end/sequence to sequence model, or a model that takes a fixed length input?
    seq2seq pros:
      - don't need to stitch together multiple outputs to form final sheet music
      - far away context might actually be important
    fixed length pros:
      - seq2seq with really long sequence might have ram problems?  i.e. entire unrolled network values are in memory
